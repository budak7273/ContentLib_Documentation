= Patching

In addition to creating new content,
you can also use _ContentLib_ to modify existing items,
recipes, and schematics,
both base-game and those added by other mods.

== File Naming Scheme and Location

Each patch file can modify exactly one asset.
If you want to patch multiple assets, use multiple patch files.

Patch JSON file names do not need to follow any specific pattern,
as they are modifying an existing asset as opposed to creating a new one,
but it is advised that you start them with the prefix of the type of asset you are patching.
For example, recipe patches should start with `+Recipe_+` and item patches with `+Desc_+`

Patch JSON files must go in the specific Patches directory instead of the content's usual asset folder.
For example, an Item patch would go in `ItemPatches`.
See xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder Names] for more info on where the file should go.

[id="PatchSyntax"]
== Syntax

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to read the documentation pages and JSON Schema for the asset you are patching
before trying to patch it.

- xref:Tutorials/CreateItem.adoc[Item Documentation]
- xref:Tutorials/CreateRecipe.adoc[Recipe Documentation]
- xref:Features/Schematics.adoc[Schematic Documentation]
====

The JSON syntax is mostly the same as creating the content,
but you must put **an additional line at the start of the file** to specify what item to overwrite.
This is called the 'patch target'.
It's the target asset's class path, with the `+_C+` suffix, prefixed with an extra slash (`/`).
The xref:Tutorials/FindAssetPath.adoc[Finding Assets]
page covers how to find this path.

For example, the line at the top of the file overriding the Turbofuel recipe must be
`//Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/AlternateRecipes/Parts/Recipe_Alternate_Turbofuel.Recipe_Alternate_Turbofuel_C`

If the path you provide is invalid, a xref:Tutorials/Troubleshooting.adoc[log message] will be output.

Just like when creating content, all fields in a patch (except the target) are optional.
If you exclude a field, the patched asset will keep its original value from before the patch was applied.

== JSON Schema

The xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] used for a Patch should be that of the asset type it is modifying.

Your editor might complain about the patch target line being a comment, since comments are not normally supported in JSON.
This is to be expected.
You can hide this error by following

== Example Item Patch

[WARNING]
====
Remember that Item Patches need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
====

Below is an example modification of the base game's "Caterium Ore" item, which is named OreGold internally.
With the power of ContentLib, you can reveal who's really behind that mask - Gold Ore!

====

This example replaces the item name and description,
but you can modify other fields, too.

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/OreGold/Desc_OreGold.Desc_OreGold_C
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Item.json",
  "Name": "Gold Ore",
  "Description": "Surely not Caterium Ore. Couldn't be!"
}
```

== Example Recipe Patch

[WARNING]
====
Remember that Recipe Patches need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
====

=== Crafting Component Recipes

This patch changes the ingredients of the usual Solid Biofuel recipe to have a custom name and custom ingredients/products.

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/Constructor/Recipe_Biofuel.Recipe_Biofuel_C
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Recipe.json",
  "Name": "Coal-based BioFuel",
  "Ingredients": [
    {
      "Item": "Desc_Coal",
      "Amount": 1
    }
  ],
  "Products": [
    {
      "Item": "Desc_Biofuel",
      "Amount": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

=== Building Recipes

Remember, the syntax for building recipes is the same as normal recipes
as described on the xref:Features/Recipes.adoc#BuildingRecipes[Recipe Creation] page.

This patch changes the the Blueprint Designer to not cost anything to build.
Yes, it's that short.
Remember - you don't need to repeat any information from the original asset that you aren't modifying!

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/Buildings/Recipe_BlueprintDesigner.Recipe_BlueprintDesigner_C
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Recipe.json",
  "ClearIngredients": true
}
```

== Example Schematic Patch

[WARNING]
====
Remember that Schematic Patches need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
====

By default, schematic patches will only append unlocks and costs to what already exists,
because this behavior provides the most compatibility with other mods.

The ClearCost, ClearRecipes, ClearSchematics, ClearScannableResources, and ClearDeps fields may be of use here.

Here's an example schematic patch that also unlocks
the 3 Turbofuel recipes at the same time as regular Fuel
while still preserving the existing unlocks.

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Schematics/Progression/Schematic_5-1.Schematic_5-1_C
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json",
    "Recipes": [
        "Recipe_Alternate_Turbofuel",
        "Recipe_Alternate_TurboHeavyFuel",
        "Recipe_Alternate_TurboBlendFuel"
    ]
}
```

Due to a base-game bug/feature, AWESOME Shop schematics and items without assigned categories are usually not displayed in menus unless they are explicitly searched for.
You can use this behavior to hide AWESOME Shop schematics from display.

Here's an example patch that makes it so the "Pretty Good Pioneering" statue does not show up in the AWESOME Shop unless specifically searched for:

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Schematics/ResourceSink/ResourceSink_StatueSilverPioneer.ResourceSink_StatueSilverPioneer_C
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json",
    "ClearSubCategories": true
}
```

Here's an example schematic patch from RePan that entirely replaces the recipe unlocks of an existing schematic with another set of recipe unlocks:

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Schematics/Progression/Schematic_6-1.Schematic_6-1_C
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json",
    "ClearRecipes": true,
    "Recipes": [
        "Recipe_GeneratorFuel",
        "Recipe_ConveyorBeltMk4",
        "Recipe_ConveyorLiftMk4",
        "Recipe_LiquidFuel"
    ]
}
```

Schematics can also unlock other schematics.
Here's an example schematic patch that will automatically unlock the "Charcoal" schematic when the "Biocoal" schematic is unlock:

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Schematics/Alternate/Parts/Schematic_Alternate_Coal1.Schematic_Alternate_Coal1_C
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json",
    "Schematics": [
        "Schematic_Alternate_Coal2_C"
    ]
}
```

Note that doing this does not prevent `Schematic_Alternate_Coal2_C` from being unlocked through its original means -
it simply adds an additional possible way to unlock it.
However, since `Schematic_Alternate_Coal2_C` is of type Alternate and this patch causes it to be unlocked,
`Schematic_Alternate_Coal2_C` will be removed from the alternate pool upon unlocking `Schematic_Alternate_Coal1_C`.
Unless there was already an unclaimed hard drive with `Schematic_Alternate_Coal2_C`, in which case selecting it would give you nothing new.

To unlock scannable resources, you can use the `ScannableResources` field.
Simply specific the resource you want to unlock and the type of node that should be scanned for.
Here's an example schematic patch that adds the ability to scan for Sulfur Nodes to the "Oil Processing" milestone in Tier 5:

```json
//Game/FactoryGame/Schematics/Progression/Schematic_5-1.Schematic_5-1_C
{
    "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_Schematic.json",
    "ScannableResources": [
        {
            "Resource": "Desc_Sulfur_C",
            "NodeType": "Node"
        }
    ]
}
```

To unlock geyser scanning, use `Geyser` as the node type and `Desc_Geyser_C` as the resource.

== Troubleshooting

If your patch isn't working, don't fret, ContentLib logs a lot of information about what it's doing to help you track down the problem.
Read more on the xref:Tutorials/Troubleshooting.adoc[Troubleshooting page].

== Background Info

=== Why do patches need the blueprint path?

The reason is simple:

* This content may not be loaded at this point in the loading sequence.
* There is no way to "Find" it by name without loading *everything*.

Therefore, this mod uses a Blueprint Path here to reliably load the Item to be Patched.

=== Why is the blueprint path not part of the Json itself?

* The step of turning the raw text into JSON is skipped when the item class fails to load to improve performance.
* Putting the path inside of the JSON would have forced this mod to do the parsing step earlier.
* Even if it were part of the JSON, it has no actual value for the Items themselves, just for the mod figuring out what to overwrite. The path resolves to either a useless nullptr or a valid pointer with no further use.
