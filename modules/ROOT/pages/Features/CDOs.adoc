= Content Default Object Modification

[NOTE]
====
You can find a xref:Reference/JsonSchema.adoc[JSON Schema] for CDOs
https://github.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/tree/main/JsonSchemas[here].
====

You can also use ContentLib to perform (Class Default Object) CDO edits,
to a limited degree, by overwriting property values.

To learn more about what a CDO is, see
https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/UnrealArchitecture/Objects/[this]
Unreal Engine documentation page.

This is an advanced feature that can modify most fields on any asset,
as long as you know where the asset is, what field to look for,
and understand the structure of the data type you are modifying.

In order to find the names of fields,
you probably will need to either have a set up modding project,
and/or look at the C++ headers shipped with the game.
Experimentation will be required to find out what fields do what.

You can attempt to hot reload CDOs via the button on the Mod Configuration screen,
or the `/CLCDOReload` chat command.
*Hot reloading is a WIP feature*, and could work, have no effect,
or possibly even crash you depending on the fields you are modifying.

There are no restrictions on the names for CDO JSON files.

This feature becomes even more powerful when paired with a mod of your own.
For example, you can use CDO edits to change the parent class of other Materials to one you packaged with your mod,
changing the appearance of anything using that material.

You can see the field types supported by ContentLib CDOs
by looking at the `UCLCDOBPFLib::EditCDO` implementation
https://github.com/Nogg-aholic/ContentLib/blob/master/Source/ContentLib/Private/CLCDOBPFLib.cpp[here].
It attempts to convert what you've entered as a string into structs and other types as needed,
but it is far from perfect.

[WARNING]
====
Remember that CDOs need to go in the correct xref:BackgroundInfo/FolderNames.adoc[Folder].
====

== Disclaimer

It's possible to do a lot of cool things with this feature, but also *cause crashes.*
On the flip side, the modifications could have *absolutely no effect whatsoever*.
ContentLib simply provides the tools to allow modifying the CDO
- there is no guarantee that the asset you are modifying will still work correctly after the fact.

For example, it is possible to use a CDO
to change the `mManufacturingSpeed` and `mExtractCycleTime` properties of miners.
xref:Tutorials/ContentInspector.adoc[Content Inspector] will confirm that the values have been changed,
but the miner's behavior in-game will not be affected.
This is not because the CDO edit has failed,
but because something about the miner's implementation is causing it to not use the values in a way we expected.
Other modders have found out through experimentation and research with a decompiler
that miner behavior can be changed via
https://docs.ficsit.app/satisfactory-modding/latest/Development/Cpp/hooking.html[hooking],
an advanced technique that requires a regular mod to use.

In this specific case, the same outcome (increased miner speed)
can be achieved by using a CDO to modify the `mCollectSpeedMultiplier` of the resource item instead.

== JSON Examples

=== Rename an Item

This renames Caterium Ingots to Gold Ingots.
You should use Item Patches instead of CDOs for this in practice.
This is just an example with a field you're likely already familiar with.

This is an example of a CDO edit that works with hot reloading.

=== Drone Port Fuels

This demonstrates the CDO feature's ability to work with arbitrary structs, to a degree.
Note that using a ContentLib CDO here overwrites the entire `mFuelTypes` array,
which is not desirable for compatibility with other mods.
Unfortunately, ContentLib CDOs do not currently have a to append to the array.

=== Recipe Ingredients Quantity Change

You should use Recipe Patches instead of CDOs for this; this is just a proof of concept.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_CDO.json",
  "Class": "/Game/FactoryGame/Recipes/Blender/Recipe_FusedModularFrame.Recipe_FusedModularFrame_C",
  "Edits": [
    {
      "Property": "mIngredients",
      "Value": [
        {
          "ItemClass": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/ModularFrameHeavy/Desc_ModularFrameHeavy.Desc_ModularFrameHeavy_C",
          "Amount": 643
        },
        {
          "ItemClass": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/Parts/AluminumCasing/Desc_AluminumCasing.Desc_AluminumCasing_C",
          "Amount": 245
        },
        {
          "ItemClass": "/Game/FactoryGame/Resource/RawResources/NitrogenGas/Desc_NitrogenGas.Desc_NitrogenGas_C",
          "Amount": 123
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

=== Change Material Instance Parent Class

https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/creating-and-using-material-instances-in-unreal-engine/[Unreal material instances]
store their parent Material as a field.
This field can be changed with CDO edits,
although it is rarely a good idea to do so.
This point of this example is just to demonstrate editing an arbitrary field on an asset.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/budak7273/ContentLib_Documentation/main/JsonSchemas/CL_CDO.json",
  "Class": "/Game/FactoryGame/-Shared/Material/MI_Factory_Base_01.MI_Factory_Base_01",
  "Edits": [
    {
      "Property": "Parent",
      "Value": "/AdaptingGenerators/Assets/MM_FactoryCopy.MM_FactoryCopy"
    }
  ]
}
```

== Blueprint Library

Perform your own CDO modifications directly with `UCLCDOBPFLib::GenerateCLCDOFromString` or `UCLCDOBPFLib::EditCDO`. See the `CL_CDO_Module` blueprint asset for examples of GenerateCLCDOFromString.
